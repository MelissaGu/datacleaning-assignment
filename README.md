The purpose of this r script is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.  

The data used for this script is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The R script uploaded does the following:
Step 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Step 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Thank you for reviewing my work.
